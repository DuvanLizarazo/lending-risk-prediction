# Project Summary

This project focuses on analyzing publicly available data from LendingClub.com, a platform that connects borrowers in need of funds with investors. The primary objective is to develop a predictive model that can assess the likelihood of borrowers repaying their loans in full, which is crucial for informed investment decisions.

The dataset under consideration covers the years 2007-2010, a period of particular interest due to significant events in 2016. This analysis will explore key variables related to borrower profiles, such as credit policy adherence, loan purpose, interest rates, and financial metrics, among others.
